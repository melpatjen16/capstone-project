MC 11/9 Notes: 
Document everything
Narrowing down a topic. What problem/issue are we solving? Restricting it to VA gives us an easier start, place to find data. 
Contextualize crime statistics with demographic/behavior data/factors/variation within commonwealth
Behavioral data on juveniles vs. adults. Not as much on adults – how are these crimes then being classified? 
Violent crimes
Crimes against Person, Crimes against Property, and Crimes against Society
What’s considered a crime vs. offense or incident is not mutually exclusive. Contextualize
Conviction rates in the commonwealth; what stems it
Conviction rates with behaviors vs convictions rates with ethnic background and location; correlation with behaviors
Chances of winning a trial — based on judges; political parties/groups; economic status/class; age, demographic; religion; locality; types of crimes
Concrete crime factors?
1. Attitudes of policies of courts, prosecutors, and corrections 1. Locality 2. Density of population 3. Economic conditions 4. Employment 5. Cultural factors 6. Family 7. Weather 8. Police jurisdictions 9. Crime reporting and other tendencies

Compare/filter out these see where it leads 
Year to year?
Contextualize crime statistics with conviction rates in Virginia to highlight the behavioral, location, and demographic(ethnic background) factors…
Nonviolent conviction rates in VA – 
*1 Finishing up EDA process (exploratory data analysis)*
What are the features and relationships between them.
Variables: Case (#, code/ID, date), location (lat/long), charge, 
Provides guidelines for essential variables and removing non-essential variables
Identify outliers
Maximize insights of dataset

2 Create a working machine learning model — supervised learning model?? Labels vs no labels
Figure out the model to help figure out how to store it
